Changes
================

---------

* Fix runtime error introduced in last release when running in Rails development environment

0.9.2
---------

* Remove use of weakrefs to track queue instances, use ObjectSpace
  instead.
* Add support for Batch operations, providing an easy way to fan out
  operations and then collect results when completed.
* Added WorkQueue.immediate! and WorkQueue.queue! to switch background processing off and back on respectively. Nice to use when testing. (jc00ke, ryanlecompte)
